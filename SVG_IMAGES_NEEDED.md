- Slightly distorted shapes to create unease
- For the jumpscare, create something abstract but frightening

Each SVG should be relatively small in file size (under 20KB if possible) and use a limited color palette.

## Example of What They Should Look Like
You can use websites like [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/) or [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) to find suitable SVG images, then modify them to look more horror-themed. Alternatively, you can create simple designs using vector graphics software like Inkscape (free) or Adobe Illustrator.

Simple designs work best - think classic horror game aesthetics like those found in games like "Limbo" or early survival horror games.
